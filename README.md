## Introduction:
The frontend is deployed in github pages at:
[https://jgcjordi.github.io/frontendProyectoCreditas/](https://jgcjordi.github.io/frontendProyectoCreditas/)

The backend is deployed in heroku.

The first time you enter the page, it will take time to load the products, because heroku disconnects the server when it is half an hour without using it and takes a while to raise it.
In addition, when the server is turned off, the data is lost as it is a
Free version, so any changes you make now will be lost if you log in after the server has been turned off.

The actions you can take are:
* Register on the web.
* Buy a phone once registered.

To consider:
* In the database there is a stock of 2 products of each phone (model-color-ram), so when you buy the same phone twice (with the same specifications) it will no longer show on the web because the stock will have finished.
